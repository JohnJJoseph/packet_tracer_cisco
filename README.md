# 🚀 packet_tracer_cisco

A hands-on networking project built using **Cisco Packet Tracer** to simulate and explore core networking concepts, including routing, DHCP, FTP, and client-server communication.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates key networking principles and configurations using Cisco Packet Tracer. It aims to provide a **practical understanding** of network behavior, routing techniques, server setup, and diagnostics in simulated environments.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is divided into the following modules:

### 🔹 1. Basic Packet Tracing
- **Objective:** Introduce fundamental packet tracing for understanding device communication.
- **Key Concepts:** Device connectivity, ping tests, MAC and IP addressing.

### 🔹 2. Default Routing Implementation
- **Objective:** Set up default routes to enable inter-network connectivity.
- **Key Concepts:** Static routing, default route (`0.0.0.0/0`), gateway configuration.

### 🔹 3. DHCP Server Configuration
- **Objective:** Automate IP address assignment using a DHCP server.
- **Key Concepts:** DHCP pool creation, excluded IP ranges, lease durations.

### 🔹 4. FTP File Server Configuration
- **Objective:** Simulate an FTP server for file sharing.
- **Key Concepts:** FTP server setup, file transfer protocols, user permissions.

### 🔹 5. Static Configurations on Routers
- **Objective:** Manually configure routing paths between networks.
- **Key Concepts:** Static routing tables, interface IPs, route propagation.
